I tried to build this from source.  It required nuget, which appears to only be available as a binary.  No matter what I tried, it was never able to find ctype.h.  I installed and reinstalled SDKs, changed the version of the SDK that the projects were looking for, etc.  Nothing worked.  It's a binary repack, but I've left the remnants of my failed source build in place in case they are helpful in the future.
